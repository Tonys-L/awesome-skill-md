# Awesome SKILL.md [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of SKILL.md skills, tools, and resources for AI coding agents.

[SKILL.md](https://www.agensi.io/learn/what-is-skill-md) is the open standard for teaching AI coding agents new capabilities. A SKILL.md file tells agents like Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, Gemini CLI, and OpenClaw how to handle specific tasks — code review, testing, documentation, DevOps, and more. Drop a skill into your agent's skills folder and it works immediately.

This list covers the best skills, resources, and tools across the ecosystem.
